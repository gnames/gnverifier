# WithCapitalization is a boolean flag. If it is true, the first rune of a
# name-string will be capitalized if it is appropriate. Use it if your input
# for some reason does not follow capitalization rules of nomenclature.

# WithSpeciesGroup is a boolean flag. If it is true, verification tries to
# search not only for the given species name, but also for its species group.
# It means that searching for "Aus bus" will also search for "Aus bus bus"
# and vice versa. This function reflects existence of autononyms in botanical
# code, and coordinated names in zoological code.
#
# WithSpeciesGroup false

# WithUninomialFuzzyMatch is a boolean flag. If it is true,
# uninomial names are verified using fuzzy matching. Beware of
# a significant amount of false positives when this flag is used.
