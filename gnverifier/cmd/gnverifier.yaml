# WithCapitalization is a boolean flag. If it is true, the first rune of a
# name-string will be capitalized if it is appropriate. Use it if your input
# for some reason does not follow capitalization rules of nomenclature.
#
# WithCapitalization false

# WithSpeciesGroup is a boolean flag. If it is true, verification tries to
# search not only for the given species name, but also for its species group.
# It means that searching for "Aus bus" will also search for "Aus bus bus"
# and vice versa. This function reflects existence of autononyms in botanical
# code, and coordinated names in zoological code.

# NsqdTCPAddress provides an address to the NSQ messenger TCP service. If
# this value is set and valid, the logs will be published to the NSQ.
# The option is ignored if `Port` is not set.
#
# If WithWebLogs option is set to `false`, but `WebLogsNsqdTCP` is set to a
# valid URL, the logs will be sent to the NSQ messanging service, but they
# wil not appear as STRERR output.
# Example: `127.0.0.1:4150`

# NsqdTCPAddress:

# NsqdContainsFilter logs should contain or not contain the value of this
# filter to be sent to NSQ service.
# Examples:
# "api" - keep logs containing "api" substring.
# "!api" - filter out logs containing "api" substtring.
#
# NsqdContainsFilter:

# NsqdRegexFilter logs should match this filter to be sent to NSQ service.
# Example:
# "api\\/(v0|v1)"

# WithWebLogs flag enables logs when running web-service. This flag is
